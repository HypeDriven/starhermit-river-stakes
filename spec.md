# River Stakes — Product and Game Specification

**Document status:** design specification only; no implementation is included.  
**Game index:** 86  
**Genre:** Turn-based card strategy  
**Players:** 2–6 seats depending on ruleset, plus practice AI  
**Targets:** desktop browsers, mobile browsers, landscape and portrait where practical  
**Rendering direction:** Three.js-first presentation with a fully usable semantic HTML interface layer

## 1. Product vision

River Stakes is a game in which players bet through staged community cards, form the best five-card hand, and win chips by showdown or folds. Its signature setting is a tasteful riverside card salon with no real-money framing. The product should feel immediately understandable, responsive within one input, and polished enough that the board or playfield itself is the visual hero. Sessions should begin quickly, make the next useful action obvious without solving the game for the player, and end with a clear explanation of score and progress.

The experience must be original. Do not copy names, layouts, characters, iconography, writing, audio, progression maps, or level data from an existing title. Use an original visual language, original procedural assets, and internally authored content.

### Design pillars

1. **Readable before spectacular:** legal actions, hazards, selection, ownership, and goals remain legible with effects disabled.
2. **One-input confidence:** every press, tap, drag, key, or pointer action gives immediate visual and sonic acknowledgment.
3. **Short path to play:** a returning player reaches the primary playfield in at most two deliberate actions.
4. **Fair mastery:** randomness is seeded and inspectable; outcomes never depend on hidden purchases or invisible stat boosts.
5. **Scalable beauty:** the same art direction survives low-power mobile hardware and high-resolution desktop displays.

## 2. Core game design

### Objective and rules contract

Bet through staged community cards, form the best five-card hand, and win chips by showdown or folds.

The rules engine must represent legal actions independently from rendering. It must expose legal-action queries, deterministic resolution, serializable state, a monotonically increasing turn/tick number, and a terminal-state reason. Tutorials and hints call the same legal-action API used by play rather than duplicating rules.

### Core loop

The repeated loop is: **post forced stakes, receive private cards, choose betting actions, reveal community stages, and settle**. Input is locked only during the shortest non-interruptible resolution phase. Cosmetic animation may continue after the logical state is ready, but skip/fast-forward must settle every object into the exact deterministic end state.

### Scoring and victory

Use play-only chips, fixed limits, responsible session reminders, and no cash-out or purchase of advantage. Results show a component breakdown rather than one unexplained total. Store integers for score and simulation units; format values only in presentation. Ties use, in order: primary objective completion, fewer invalid actions, lower authoritative elapsed time, then stable session identifier.

### Modes

- **Learn:** interactive lessons introduce one rule at a time and require the player to perform the action.
- **Journey:** authored progression with gradually combined mechanics and periodic mastery stages.
- **Daily:** one shared seed and ruleset per UTC day, from the device clock.
- **Practice:** selectable difficulty, restart, undo where rules permit, and no effect on competitive rating.
- **Challenge:** constrained goals such as move limits, speed targets, altered layouts, or restricted tools.
- **Hosted play:** not offered in the client; a future version would use StarHermit realtime rooms (private invitations, reconnect, authoritative results).

### Difficulty and content generation

- Represent content as versioned data: identifier, seed, initial state, goals, allowed mechanics, par values, tutorial flags, and presentation theme.
- Run offline validators to prove basic legality, reachable goals, bounded duration, and absence of soft locks. Logic puzzles additionally require a unique or explicitly accepted solution class.
- Difficulty is measured from solution depth, branching factor, time pressure, motor precision, hidden information, and recovery options—not merely larger numbers.
- Introduce one new concept in isolation, combine it with one known concept, then test mastery before adding another.
- Daily seeds are immutable after publication. If content is defective, mark the day excluded from ranking rather than silently replacing it.

### Game-state model

`boot → title → profile-ready → mode-select → preparing → tutorial/countdown → active ↔ paused/reconnecting → resolving → results → progression`.

Every transition has one owner and an explicit reason. Backgrounding pauses solo simulation. In hosted play, the authoritative clock continues where rules require it, while the returning client receives a fresh snapshot and a concise “while you were away” summary.

## 3. Interaction and user-interface design

### Information hierarchy

1. **Primary:** playfield, current objective, legal interaction target, and immediate danger or turn state.
2. **Secondary:** score/progress, remaining moves or time, opponent/party status where applicable.
3. **Tertiary:** settings, social controls, cosmetics, help, and history.

The Three.js canvas fills the game region but is never the only UI. Menus, text, forms, chat, settings, and assistive descriptions use semantic HTML over or beside the canvas. Maintain a single shared layout model so DOM labels align with projected Three.js targets.

### Responsive layouts

- **Wide desktop (≥1024 CSS px):** centered playfield, objective/progression rail on the left, contextual actions and social/status rail on the right. Maximum line length is 70 characters.
- **Compact desktop/tablet:** playfield remains central; secondary rails collapse into drawers. Pointer hover may preview but never be required.
- **Portrait mobile:** top safe-area status bar, square or perspective-fit playfield, bottom thumb-zone action tray, and sheet-based secondary panels. Never place critical controls under browser chrome or display cutouts.
- **Landscape mobile:** reserve a narrow status rail; preserve at least 44×44 CSS-pixel targets and 8-pixel separation.
- **Large screens (above 1600×1000):** the shared `ui-scale.js` sets `--ui-scale` and every DOM UI layer (`#ui`, modals, toasts, frame-rate meter) is CSS-zoomed by it, so menus, rails, seats and the action tray keep their 1600×1000 proportions up to 4K; the full-window 3D table stays unzoomed. The 3D seat ring follows the same clockwise order as the DOM seat chips (next seat on the viewer's left).
- React to resize, orientation, device-pixel-ratio, safe-area insets, virtual keyboard, and visibility changes without losing input or restarting the round.

### Screens and overlays

- **Title/home:** Play is dominant; daily challenge, journey progress, and profile are one level below.
- **Mode setup:** show rules, expected duration, player count, assists, and whether the result is ranked before commitment.
- **Play HUD:** objective, progress, current actor/state, pause, and only context-relevant actions.
- **Pause/settings:** resume first; audio, graphics, controls, accessibility, help, and leave are clearly separated.
- **Results:** outcome headline, score breakdown, progress, achievements, comparison, replay/retry, and next recommended action.
- **Help:** visual rule cards generated from current control mappings and representative legal states.
- Lobby, roster, readiness, invitation, reconnect, result, and report states are first-class screens.

### Input

- Pointer/touch: raycast only against explicit interaction layers; use pointer capture for drags; cancel safely on lost capture.
- Touch: distinguish tap, drag, and camera gesture by distance/time thresholds; never require multi-touch for core play.
- Keyboard: directional navigation among legal targets, confirm, cancel, pause, undo/hint where valid, and camera reset.
- Gamepad: focus navigation, primary/secondary actions, pause, and remappable axes/buttons.
- Prevent accidental double commits with action identifiers, not arbitrary long debounce timers. Provide visible drag origin, target preview, and invalid-action explanation.

### Accessibility

- Full keyboard operation and visible focus; DOM equivalents for canvas controls; headings and live regions for objective, turn, score, errors, and results.
- Color is reinforced by shape, texture, icon, or label. Include contrast-safe and common color-vision palettes.
- Reduced-motion mode removes camera swoops, shake, parallax, rapid particles, and large scaling while preserving event timing.
- Independent sliders for music, effects, ambience, and voice; captions/text cues for meaningful audio; no audio-only gameplay.
- Options for larger text, high contrast, left-handed controls, hold-versus-toggle, timing assistance, haptics off, and tutorial replay.
- Announce Three.js board state through a concise navigable model rather than describing every decorative object.

## 4. Visual and audio design

### Visual contract

The subject is the active playfield at near-tabletop to room scale, framed so state changes occupy most of the screen. The scene is a tasteful riverside card salon with no real-money framing. Use an authored camera, original procedural geometry, restrained environmental storytelling, and a deterministic visual seed. The no-post-processing baseline must still communicate hierarchy, depth, selection, and state.

### Three.js scene design

- Use physically based lighting and color management with one dominant key, soft environment fill, and contact grounding. Gameplay colors are tested after tone mapping.
- Build reusable semantic meshes for active pieces, board cells, obstacles, targets, and environment modules. Geometry detail follows silhouette importance and camera distance.
- Use instancing for repeated pieces and props, pooled effects, texture atlases where appropriate, and explicit disposal on scene changes.
- Separate render layers for environment, gameplay, selection/ghosts, effects, and UI anchors. Cosmetic particles never intercept raycasts.
- Selection uses a combination of lift/pose, outline or rim, and grounded marker—not bloom alone. Legal targets preview before commit; invalid targets explain why.
- Event hierarchy: input acknowledgment < legal move < combo/goal < round completion. Reserve camera motion, strong emission, and dense particles for the highest tier.
- Audio uses original short transients tied to logical events, layered material impacts, quiet ambience, and adaptive music stems. Randomized pitch/variant is seeded for replay consistency where recording matters.

### Graphics

Lighting combines a warm key light with PCF soft shadows (its shadow box is fitted to the table, the seats and the table's shadow on the deck), a hemisphere fill and a small ambient term, rendered with ACES filmic tone mapping and sRGB output. With detailed surfaces, a `RoomEnvironment` prefiltered through `PMREMGenerator` is the scene environment, so PBR surfaces pick up soft reflections (the flat fills step back to keep contrast): the table wood carries a procedural grain, the felt a woven nap and darker rim, a brushed brass inlay runs along the rail, chips gain edge spots, a dashed inlay ring and a lacquer clearcoat, cards a light clearcoat, lanterns a glowing halo, far-bank trees appear and two lantern point lights warm the deck; the DOM board's cards and panels get a matching lacquered, lamplit finish. The river reflects the sky toward the far bank and breaks the lantern light into ripples. Optional effects: GTAO ambient occlusion (nameplates and depth-less overlays are excluded), bloom limited to lanterns, halos and bright glints (high threshold), a colour grade with a light vignette, FXAA/SMAA/MSAA anti-aliasing, and warm fireflies drifting over the deck. Fireflies, river ripples and lantern flicker stop with reduced motion. The Settings screen (also reachable from the in-game pause menu) has a **Graphics** section: Quality (Auto, chosen from the detected GPU — software renderers get Low, discrete GPUs and Apple M-series get High, everything else Balanced, with touch devices capped at Balanced — then Low, Balanced, High, Ultra); Render scale (50–200% of the preset's scale); one override per effect — shadows (off / 1024 / 2048 / 4096), ambient occlusion (off / on / high), bloom, colour grade, anti-aliasing, particles (low: small win burst only / high: fireflies and full confetti), river water (still / animated) and surface detail (plain / detailed) — each defaulting to "From preset (…)"; Adaptive resolution (averages 90 frames, steps the resolution down to 60% when frames exceed 26 ms and back up when under 14 ms); Show frame rate (a small readout in the bottom-left corner that never covers controls); and a summary line with the GPU name, cost and pixel size. Choosing a preset clears overrides. Changes apply immediately without reload, persist with the other settings, and set `data-gfx-preset` on `<html>` and the canvas. The pixel ratio is the device ratio capped per preset (Low 1, Balanced 1.5, High/Ultra 2) × preset scale × render scale × adaptive scale. Low renders directly without a post chain (as cheap as the original look); if post-processing cannot be built, the table renders without it and the panel says so. The Graphics strings are localized (en-US, en-GB, es-419, es-ES, de-DE, fr-FR, fr-CA, pt-BR, it-IT) following the browser language.

### Camera and motion

- Choose orthographic or low-distortion perspective according to depth requirements; expose framing constants rather than magic offsets.
- Camera transitions use authored duration/easing or critically damped springs and remain interruptible. Never animate by cumulative per-frame lerp.
- Decorative motion is paused or reduced when hidden. Gameplay animation derives from simulation state and interpolation alpha, not frame count.
- Camera shake is low-amplitude, event-tiered, disabled by reduced motion, and never changes raycast truth.

### Graphics-skill routing

During implementation, begin with `threejs-skill-router` and load only the following retained skills because they materially affect this visual target:

- `threejs-camera-direction` for deliberate framing and input-safe camera transitions
- `threejs-procedural-geometry` for authored, inspectable meshes instead of primitive-only placeholders
- `threejs-procedural-materials` for coherent PBR surfaces, perceptual parameters, and readable state masks
- `threejs-procedural-animation` for deterministic motion phases, springs, and interruption-safe transitions
- `threejs-procedural-vfx` for bounded particles, trails, impact accents, and event hierarchy
- `threejs-exposure-color-grading` for tone mapping, adaptation limits, and accessible color separation
- `threejs-image-pipeline` for explicit depth/color ownership and pass ordering
- `threejs-visual-validation` for fixed-view captures, seed sweeps, and performance evidence

Follow the skill pack's acceptance gate: deterministic seeds, debug views for controlling fields, perceptually grouped parameters, mechanism-backed quality tiers, and a readable no-post baseline. Do not add an effect merely because a skill exists.

### Performance budgets

- Target 60 fps at the default tier and a stable 30 fps fallback on constrained mobile hardware.
- Default active gameplay: ≤150 draw calls desktop, ≤90 mobile; ≤350k visible triangles desktop, ≤140k mobile; transient particles ≤20k desktop and ≤5k mobile.
- Cap device pixel ratio by quality tier; dynamically lower render scale before dropping simulation rate. UI text remains native resolution.
- Avoid runtime shader compilation during active play by prewarming required variants. Avoid per-frame allocations in simulation/render loops.
- Quality tiers independently control shadows, environment detail, particles, post effects, antialiasing, and render scale; they never alter rules or visibility of hazards.

## 5. Technical architecture

### Client modules

- `bootstrap`: host handshake, capability detection, asset manifest, lifecycle.
- `rules`: pure deterministic state transitions, legality, scoring, seeded random stream.
- `session`: local or hosted commands, snapshots, prediction policy, reconnect, replay.
- `render`: Three.js scene graph, semantic entity views, camera, lighting, VFX, graphics settings and post chain (`js/render.js`).
- `gfx`: pure graphics quality model — presets, per-effect overrides, GPU detection, cost summary (`js/gfx.js`); Graphics panel strings per locale (`js/gfx-strings.js`). Post-processing and environment addons are vendored from the same three.js release (0.160.1) under `vendor/three/addons/` and resolved through the page's import map.
- `ui`: responsive DOM shell, focus, localization, settings, overlays, accessibility mirror.
- `audio`: buses, event mapping, focus/background behavior, decode and memory policy.
- `content`: versioned levels, themes, tutorials, validation metadata.
- `platform`: token-aware REST/WebSocket adapter, retries, rate-limit handling, telemetry consent.

No module may mutate rules state except through a validated command. Rendering consumes immutable snapshots plus interpolation data. UI state and simulation state are separate so closing a drawer cannot affect a match.

### Determinism, replay, and security

- Fixed simulation step where physics exists; quantize authoritative inputs and define stable collision/order rules.
- Use separate seeded random streams for rules, content decoration, and audiovisual variants. Cosmetic randomness never changes rules.
- Replay envelope: schema version, build/content version, seed, initial hash, timestamp offset, ordered commands, periodic state hashes, terminal result.
- Validate all network input for identity, session membership, turn/tick, bounds, rate, payload size, and legal action. Reject duplicates idempotently by command ID.
- Treat client clocks, scores, inventories, roles, physics outcomes, and completion claims as untrusted in competitive contexts.

### Loading and resilience

- Show useful progress by asset group; load core rules/UI first and scenic assets lazily. Provide procedural low-detail substitutes if optional assets fail.
- Cache immutable hashed assets and the last safe local snapshot. Updates activate between rounds, never during one.
- Recover WebGL context by rebuilding GPU resources from retained CPU descriptors. If 3D is unavailable, present a clear compatibility message and preserve account/session state.
- Background tabs reduce rendering to zero or a low heartbeat while preserving required network lifecycle.

## 6. StarHermit integration

### Packaging and launch
- Ship a browser distribution with `starhermit.txt` at its root, `name=River Stakes`, and `launch=index.html`. Keep source files, secrets, design documents, and source maps outside the uploaded distribution.
- All platform access goes through the canonical StarHermit SDK (`starhermit-sdk.js`, an unedited copy of `tools/starhermit-sdk.js`, loaded before the modules) wrapped by `js/platform.js`. `StarHermit.init()` runs first at boot: it reads the launch token from `#game_token=` or `#access_token=`, strips it, takes the slug from `game_scope`, keeps the token in memory and renews it. If renewal is refused the game keeps playing locally and the title offers sign-in again.
- On `*.starhermit.com` without a token the title shows **Sign in with StarHermit**; it is hidden when signed in and when running locally.
- Daily boundaries use the device clock's UTC day everywhere. Without a launch token the game makes no network request at all (no platform calls, no own-server `/api` or `/ws` calls).

### Identity, profile, presence, and preferences
- Guests keep a local table name; with a token the table name is the account nickname from `StarHermit.profile()` ("Player <id>" fallback), read-only in-game. No presence heartbeats are sent.
- The settings groups (audio, graphics, accessibility, ui) mirror to the per-game settings KV: applied from `getSettings()` at boot (platform wins over local values) and patched (changed groups only, debounced) on every change.
- Keyboard actions are declared as `control.*` lines in `starhermit.txt`; keydown is routed by `event.code` through `StarHermit.loadBindings()`, and How to play plus the in-game shortcut bar list the effective keys. Touch stays responsive UI.
- Progress, personal-best boards and the profile name are cloud-saved as one versioned JSON document in the `game:<slug>` slot: `loadJSON()` remote-first at boot (an empty slot is seeded from the local copy), `saveJSON()` debounced ~2 s, `flushSave(true)` on `pagehide`/hide, with a visible sync status. localStorage remains the offline cache. Never place credentials or private chat in saves.

### Discovery, activity, and social layer
- The platform exposes no per-game activity/presence/telemetry routes reachable by launch tokens, so the game reports none; playtime stays local. Surface entitlement or catalog state only in host-owned chrome; the game itself must remain playable without promotional interruption.
- When signed in, the title shows **Invite a friend**, which copies `StarHermit.inviteLink()` with a confirmation toast. There is no in-game friends picker or session invite inbox: on-platform tables are solo against the house AI.
- Use friend invitations and the game-invite inbox for private sessions (future, once hosted tables exist on realtime rooms). Text chat, when added, belongs in a collapsible, moderated panel with block/report hooks, unread state, a 10-message-per-minute-aware composer, and no chat over critical controls.
- Offer voice rooms only as an explicit opt-in after joining a compatible conversation. Default muted, expose speaking/mute indicators, and provide leave/report controls. Core rules must never require voice.

### Achievements and leaderboards
- Declare a small static achievement set: first completion, mechanic mastery, a sustained streak, a difficult content milestone, and an accessibility-neutral long-term goal. Keys are stable, lowercase identifiers; unlocks are idempotent. A pure browser game has no server-authoritative unlock path: unlocks stay local and ride in the cloud-saved doc.
- Leaderboards are platform-owned and read-only: the board id comes from `StarHermit.getGame()` (or the first of `leaderboards()`), entries from `leaderboardEntries()` rendered with profile nicknames; no standings panel when there is no board. Personal bests (ruleset, content version, seed, assists, duration attached) stay in localStorage + the cloud mirror; the client never submits scores.

### Sessions and transport
- The client is solo against the house AI. The repo's `server.js` still contains a dev-only JSON-room relay over `/ws` (used by its tests), but the client never connects to it; a future multiplayer mode would use StarHermit realtime rooms (host-routed) for lobby/matchmaking.
- Run rules in a sandboxed authoritative JavaScript Game Script. Persist compact JSON state, whitelist public messages, reject out-of-turn or malformed input, use platform time for deadlines, and end through the authoritative result contract.
- Use gameplay WebSocket events for immediate move/result updates, but make REST session detail the reconnect source of truth. The peer relay is unnecessary for the initial turn-based design.

### Publishing and operations
- Keep the authoritative script inside the distribution and declare it with `server=server.js`. Choose a digest-pinned container only if profiling proves the sandbox unsuitable; no initial design here requires one.
- Define control defaults, achievement metadata, and versioned settings before release. Publish immutable build assets, verify the launch path, maintain migration tests for saves, and expose no secret configuration to the client.
- Capture anonymous funnel events only for start, tutorial step, round end, retry, settings change, and error category. Avoid raw text, precise personal data, and cross-title tracking.

## 7. Content, economy, and retention

- Launch scope: tutorial sequence, at least 40 authored stages or equivalent procedural depth, daily challenge, practice, five visual themes, and a mastery track.
- Cosmetic rewards may alter materials, trails, board surrounds, ambience, or profile flourishes, but never hitboxes, timing windows, information, or power.
- Reward cadence: early feedback every session, meaningful unlock every 3–5 sessions, and long-term goals visible without manipulative countdowns.
- No real-money wagering, paid random rewards, forced advertising, energy pressure, punitive streak loss, or purchases that affect competitive outcomes.
- Notifications, if ever added by the host, are opt-in, frequency-capped, quiet-hour aware, and never use false urgency.

## 8. Analytics and privacy

Measure tutorial completion, first meaningful action time, session duration bands, level attempts, quit state, input modality, performance tier, reconnect success, and accessibility feature usage only in aggregate. Use random session identifiers, short retention, and explicit consent where required. Never collect message content, drawings, voice, private board notes, or exact pointer trails as analytics.

Success targets for the first public test: median first-play time under 20 seconds, tutorial completion above 80%, crash-free sessions above 99.5%, p95 input acknowledgment below 100 ms locally, and at least 95% of supported mobile sessions holding their selected frame-rate tier.

## 9. Testing and acceptance criteria

### Rules and content

- Unit-test every legal action, invalid-action reason, scoring component, terminal state, and serialization migration.
- Property-test deterministic replay: the same version, seed, and commands produce identical state hashes.
- Fuzz malformed commands and generated content; prove no hangs, NaN physics, impossible mandatory states, or unbounded loops.
- Golden-test representative easy, medium, hard, interrupted, resumed, and terminal sessions.

### Interface and accessibility

- Test pointer, coarse touch, keyboard-only, gamepad, screen reader, zoom to 200%, reduced motion, high contrast, safe areas, and both mobile orientations.
- Verify focus restoration after every modal, meaningful live announcements, no keyboard traps, and no hover-only instructions.
- Confirm all critical labels fit translated strings at 30% expansion and support right-to-left layout where localized.

### Graphics and performance

- Produce fixed-camera captures for every quality tier, deterministic seed sweeps, no-post baselines, debug-view mosaics, and 10-minute temporal stability runs.
- Profile CPU, GPU, memory, shader compilation, draw calls, triangles, texture memory, and garbage collection on representative desktop and mobile classes.
- Verify effects cannot obscure legal targets, alter picking, leak resources, or continue expensive updates while hidden.

### Platform and network

- Test expired/rotated tokens, privacy settings, rate limits, offline start, reconnect at each game state, duplicate commands, out-of-order events, server restart, and version mismatch.
- Verify achievement idempotency, leaderboard validation, friends-only filtering, cloud-save conflict handling, activity start/end pairing, and server-time countdown accuracy.
- For hosted sessions, test disconnect/rejoin, abandonment, timeout, invitation expiry, result reconciliation, replay access, moderation controls, and authoritative cheat attempts.

## 10. Definition of done and non-goals

This specification is ready for implementation when rules examples, content schema, wireframes for all responsive breakpoints, visual target frames, accessibility annotations, authoritative message schema, achievement definitions, leaderboard definitions, and performance test devices are approved.

This document does **not** authorize implementation, asset production, monetization work, native wrappers, real-money systems, or copying any existing product. The initial build should favor one excellent core loop and a coherent original visual identity over feature breadth.

## Browser interference

`browser-guard.js` (loaded from `index.html`) suppresses browser UI that gets in the way of play: the right-click context menu, the iOS long-press callout, copy / cut / paste, and page text selection. Text fields (inputs, textareas, selects, contenteditable) keep normal selection, context menu and clipboard behaviour.
